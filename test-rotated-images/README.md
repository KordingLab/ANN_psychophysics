### Does the Fisher of layers with respect to orientation really reflect image statistics?

This folder includes scripts to train networks with various perturbations to their inputs (see `train_rotated.py`).

It also includes scripts to quickly calculate the Fisher with respect to any image generator (as exemplified in the notebook `Fisher_of_trained_nets.ipynb` and the scripts in `fisher_calculators.py`)
